                After many years living away, Leila always knew she wanted to re-establish roots in San Diego, which is where she grew up. With her best friend, a toy goldendoodle named Max, she came home. She built a new life, surrounded by family, friends, and her beloved yoga community.
                            <br><br>It was through this same yoga community in Encinitas that Leila met Zach.
                            <br><br>Zach, already a member of this yoga community, had briefly left to pursue his career. But he always knew San Diego would be his forever home. And when he met Leila, he moved back.
                            <br><br>Together, as partners and best friends, they care for Max and a new member of the family, another toy goldendoodle named Bentley. And now, they are beginning the next great chapter of their lives together in Carlsbad. And they’re thrilled to invite you to celebrate in that special moment.
                            <br><br>Love,<br>Leila & Zach
